                I have been developing software for over 10 years. I developed a passion for it when I was in my teenage years,
                and over the next 15 years I have, in one form or another, developed websites and web applications
                continuously. I began developing websites for family, friends, and eventually evolved into commercial
                software development. I am currently employed as software developer, and I spend about 10 hours a day
                completely immersed. My goal is to take the knowledge that I have acquired and use it to create a software
                development firm that will be the benchmark for software companies of the future
